UX Portfolio

Took me a week to work on this new portfolio website.

Lots of challengs along the way:
* npm serve was out of date, had to update it ... but in turn found out my Homebrew was out of date
* ended up removing homebrew because I didn't like the dependence NodeJS had on it
* Using FTP I got my files hosted ... but nothing got published. Support agent said he had to change the name server to get it working
* After 15 minutes, my files slowly get published ...then stopped ... wondering if it's because AWS is down or something?
* Ended up making a [redirect page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5411538/redirect-from-an-html-page) to my portfolio that's hosted on Github.
